// test function is globally available, you don't need to import
// it from somewhere
// When writing a test, you have to do 3 A's.
// 1) Arrange, set up the test data, test conditions and test environment
// 2) Act, run logic that should be tested (e.g. execute function)
// 3) Assert, compare execution results with expected results.
